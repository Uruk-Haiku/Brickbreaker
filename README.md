# Brickbreaker
Implementing Brickbreaker A.K.A. Breakout (the classic video game) in Assembly using MIPS.

This game can most easily be run, examined, modified and played in MARS. However, note that due to a noticeable and highly annoying MARS bug, doing >1 keyboard inputs in one clock cycle will cause MARS to freeze and have to be force-closed. So, please do not hold down keys and don't press them as fast as humanly possible, though for normal play, it should work fine. We have tried to fix this bug, we can't. MARS, please fix!

Anyway, enjoy!
